## Practical Lab (45 Minutes)

### Step 1: Collect Components
Gather all necessary components for today's session.

### Step 2: Connection / Setup
Follow the block diagram and secure all cables. Ensure a stable connection.

### Step 3: Write Code
Here is the code structure for today:

```cpp
// C++ Arduino Code
#include <Servo.h>
Servo myServo;

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(9600);
    myServo.attach(9);
    pinMode(13, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
    myServo.write(90);
    digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
    delay(1000);
}
```

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem | Solution |
|:---|:---|
| No signal output | Check VCC and Ground rails configuration |
| Serial logs offline | Check connection rate (Baud mismatch) |
| System freezing | Clean compile variables, reset board |

## Quiz (5 Minutes)

**Q1.** Explain what you built today in your own words.

**Q2.** What is the purpose of `Automatic Irrigation`?
> Answer: It acts as the key parameter for control and calibration in today's setup.

**Q3.** Name a real-world application of this session's project.
> Answer: Smart automation, aerospace tracking, or local control grids.
